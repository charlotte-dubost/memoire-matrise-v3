The microﬂuidic networks were fabricated by the robotized direct deposition of fugitive ink ﬁlaments in a layer-by-layer sequence onto substrates, followed by their epoxy encapsulation and the ink removal. Then, the nanocomposite suspensions prepared by ultrasonication and three-roll mill mixing methods were injected into the empty networks under two different controlled and constant pressures in order to subject the suspensions to different shear conditions in the microchannels. Morphological studies revealed that the SWCNTs were preferentially aligned in the microchannels along the ﬂow direction at the higher injection pressure. The improvement of Young’s modulus of the manufactured 3D-reinforced rectangular beams prepared at the high injection pressure was almost doubled when compared to that of beams prepared at the low injection pressure. Finally, the stiffness of the 3D-reinforced beams was compared with the theoretically predicted values obtained from a micromechanical model. The analytical predictions give a close estimation of the stiffness at different micro-injection conditions. Based on the experimental and theoretical results, the present manufacturing technique enables the spatial orientation of nanotube in the ﬁnal product by taking advantage of shear ﬂow combined with dimensional constraining inside the microﬂuidic channels.},

The nanocomposite formulation obtained after a comprehensive investigation of composition and processing techniques possesses a piezoelectric coeﬃcient, d31, of 18 pC N−1, which is comparable to that of typical poled and stretched commercial PVDF ﬁlm sensors. A 3D contact sensor that generates up to 4 V upon gentle ﬁnger taps demonstrates the eﬃcacy of the fabrication technique.

Six students from the National Circus School of Montre´al performed 5–10 trials of an acrobatic movement called dislock in aerial circus straps while tension force was measured at the hanging point of the aerial apparatus. The repeatability of force signals was calculated with three statistical methods: time-averaged standard deviation, intraclass correlation and root mean square error. These methods were compared with the ratings of a circus coach who ranked each acrobat’s trial with regard to the movement variability. The standard deviation and the intraclass correlation methods are commonly used to quantify the agreement between measurements in biomechanics, while the root mean square error method is regularly employed to quantify the agreement between measurements and a model. All participants performed the movement with little variability (intraclass correlation 5 0.8). The results of the three methods were in good agreement with the coach’s assessment. The root mean square error method, in particular, showed perfect agreement and is therefore considered the best measure of repeatability. In the future, the proposed method could be used by coaches or artists training alone, allowing a new form of feedback.},

With a pair of high-speed cameras, a stereoscopic vision method is adopted to perform omnidirectional measurements for the temporal evolution of the disc's motion. The experiment data allow us to detail the dynamics of the disc, and consequently to quantify its energy. From our experimental observations, it is confirmed that rolling friction is a primary factor responsible for the dissipation of the energy. Furthermore, a mathematical model, in which the rolling friction is characterized by a resistance torque proportional to the square of precession rate, is also proposed. By employing the model, we perform qualitative analysis and numerical simulations. Both of them provide results that precisely agree with our experimental findings.},

The only existing theoretical model examines the terminal stages of the motion and proposes air drag as the primary agency behind the sudden stop. Subsequent experimental work has tended to favour rolling friction or sliding friction as the principal motivator. Here I show that a combination of rolling friction and sliding friction is necessary and suﬃcient to understand the complete motion of the disk. Rolling friction is dominant in the initial stages of the fall but it changes to sliding friction after the disk dips below a certain angle with the horizontal plane. The change occurs as a result of the inability of the normal reaction to provide the torque for the motion. Qualitatively, this model can account for all the observations associated with the disk. Quantitative analysis has been carried out with the friction treated as perturbations on the corresponding steady-state frictionless solutions and a ﬁnite-time singularity in the precession rate has been obtained with a critical exponent of 1/2.},

The aim of this paper is to present the various dissipation mechanisms for a rolling disk which are used in the literature in a uniﬁed framework. Furthermore, new experiments on the ‘Euler disk’ using a high-speed video camera and a novel image analysis technique are presented. The combined experimental/theoretical approach of this paper sheds some more light on the dominant dissipation mechanism on the time-scale of several seconds.},

A mechanical model of a rolling disk is presented in the framework of Non-smooth Dynamics and Convex Analysis. In an analytical study, approximations are derived for the energy decay of the system during the ﬁnal stage of the motion for various kinds of frictional dissipation models. Finally, the numerical and analytical results are discussed and compared with experimental results available in literature.},

The presence of symmetry leads, upon the choice of an arbitrary principal connection, to a reduced D’Alembert’s principle and to the Lagrange–D’Alembert–Poincare´ reduced equations. The case of rolling constraints has a long history and it has been the purpose of many works in recent times. In this paper we ﬁnd reduced equations for the case of a thick disk rolling on a rough surface, sometimes called Euler’s disk, using a 3-dimensional abelian group of symmetry. We also show how the reduced system can be transformed into a single second order equation, which is an hypergeometric equation.},

The conditions of steady motion are derived for both kinds of ground and it is shown that the possible steady motion of a disk is either on a straight line or in a circle. Oscillations about steady state are discussed and conditions for stable motion established. The bifurcations of steady motions on a smooth surface are also considered.},
